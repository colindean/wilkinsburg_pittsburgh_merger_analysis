<h2>Quick Take</h2>

<p>
  Homeowners: if your earned income is greater than 107.2% of your property assessment,
  you will pay more tax as a Pittsburgh resident than as a Wilkinsburg resident.
  Someone with Wilkinsburg's March 2022 median residential property assessment of $33,200 and 2020 median
  household earned income of $37,649 would pay approximately $41 more tax yearly.
</p>
<p>
  Renters: all renters will pay more tax as Pittsburgh residents.
  It would be unprecedented for Pittsburgh City Council to order landlords to lower
  rents relative to how much less property tax the landlord is paying.
  According to the US Census Bureau, 65% of Wilkinsburg residents are renters.
</p>

<h2>Scenario Descriptions</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Wilkinsburg</dt>
    <dd>
        Your current taxation as a Wilkinsburg resident,
        and what your taxation would be going forward if no annexation occurs.
    </dd>
    <dt>Pittsburgh &amp; Pittsburgh SD (full merger)</dt>
    <dd>
        This would be your estimated taxation as a Pittsburgh resident,
        should Pittsburgh annex Wilkinsburg and make no changes to tax rates in the process
        <em>and</em> the Wilkinsburg and Pittsburgh school districts merge.
    </dd>
    <dt>Wilkinsburg, Pittsburgh SD (school district merger only)</dt>
    <dd>
        This would be your estimated taxation should Pittsburgh
        <em>not</em> annex Wilkinsburg but the school districts <em>do</em> merge or
        Wilkinsburg SD is simply dissolved.
        The Pittsburgh SD imposes a tax on incomes in addition to property tax.
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Oliver,_Pennsylvania#Taxation">Borough of Mt. Oliver</a> uses Pittsburgh SD in this way.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Scenario Notes</h2>

<h3>Other Tax-Like Fees and Municipal Services</h3>
<p>This calculator does not account for any changes to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A $200 municipal services fee for Wilkinsburg property owners paid yearly to Turtle Creek Valley Council of Governments for refuse collection.
    City of Pittsburgh does not charge a fee for this service; it is assumed included as a part of city taxes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Any changes to water and sewage bills.
    Wilkinsburg-Penn Joint Water Authority is separate from the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority.
    I speculate that it is unlikely that these two entities would merge, but I know that such would be a separate merger process.
  </li>
  <li>
    The City of Pittsburgh has a higher realty transfer tax (RTT) than Wilkinsburg. This increases the cost of purchasing a home.
    It stands at 5% and may be the highest in the country, according to <a href="https://taxnews.ey.com/news/2018-0396-city-of-pittsburgh-increases-realty-transfer-tax-rate">this E&Y report</a>. The <a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/real-estate/realty-transfer-tax-municipality-rates.aspx">Allegheny County Realty Transfer Tax database</a> lists Wilkinsburg as 0.5% each to Wilkinsburg borough and Wilkinsburg SD (1% total) in addition to the 1% that goes to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for a total of 2% RTT. The same database shows 3% to the City of Pittsburgh and 1% to the Pittsburgh SD. RTT is paid by the purchaser as a part of closing costs. As a result, it would become more expensive to purchase property in Wilkinsburg, paying $3,000 more per $100,000.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Annexation and Merger Procedures</h3>
<p>
    It is important to understand that the annexation of the municipality
    automatically merges the school districts because of Pittsburgh's size under state law.
    The school districts could merge separately but would require the approval of the State Board of Education.
    More details follow.
</p>
<h4>Municipalities</h4>
<p>
  Per <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-53-ps-municipal-and-quasimunicipal-corporations/pa-st-sect-53-13301.html"
         title="Pennsylvania Statutes Title 53 P.S. Municipal and Quasi-Municipal Corporations § 13301. Consent of voters of political subdivision annexed"
         >PA Title 53 Part I Ch. 4 § 13301</a>, as well as much of the rest of
  <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-53-ps-municipal-and-quasimunicipal-corporations/"
     title="Pennsylvania Statutes Title 53 P.S. Municipal and Quasi-Municipal Corporations"
     >PA 53 Part I Ch. 4 § 171-181</a>the procedure is approximately as follows.
  Following the collection, validation, and court acceptance of valid signatures within a three-month period
  of 5% of the Wilkinsburg registered voters
  (<a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-53-ps-municipal-and-quasimunicipal-corporations/pa-st-sect-53-171.html"
      title="Pennsylvania Statutes Title 53 P.S. Municipal and Quasi-Municipal Corporations § 171. Annexation of adjacent municipality;  petition to quarter sessions"
      >PA 53 Part I Ch. 4 § 171</a>)
  or 20% "of the highest number of votes cast for any office at the last preceding general election"
  (<a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-53-ps-municipal-and-quasimunicipal-corporations/pa-st-sect-53-30251.html"
      title="Pennsylvania Statutes Title 53 P.S. Municipal and Quasi-Municipal Corporations § 30251. Annexation of boroughs and townships;  petition to court of quarter sessions"
      >PA 53 Part I Ch. 4 § 30251</a>),
  the <b>City of Pittsburgh council</b> would have to approve the petition/referendum by simple majority vote before
  <b>Wilkinsburg voters</b> would vote on annexation through a ballot question referendum
  at an election at least 60 days after the acceptance of the petition and approval by City council.
  If it passes, the procedure is
  <i>(to be researched &mdash;
    only 11 of 16 annexation and three of 21 consolidation proposals statewide between 1975&ndash;2014 have succeeded,
    most were townships and boroughs merging;
    see
    <a
       href="https://whyy.org/articles/mergers-and-consolidations-how-municipalities-change-boundaries/"
       title="Municipal mergers and consolidations: solution for distressed municipalities?"
       >this WHYY article</a>)</i>.
  If the referendum fails, it cannot be revisited for five years.
</p>
<p>
  City of Pittsburgh voters do not have a direct, popular voice in the matter.
  Borough of Wilkinsburg council may have limited power to intercede.
  If Borough council supported the annexation, it could vote to send the question to referendum.
  In any case, a public referendum of Wilkinsburg voters is required for the annexation to occur.
</p>
<h4>School Districts</h4>
<p>
  Per
  <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-24-ps-education/pa-st-sect-24-2-229.html">PA Title 24 § 2-229</a>,
  the school districts would merge immediately upon annexation.
  Statues indicate that <a
     href="https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-24-ps-education/pa-st-sect-24-2-229.html"
     title="Pennsylvania Statutes Title 24 P.S. Education § 2-229. Annexation to district of first class or first class A"
     >annexation of the territory of a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th class school district
      by a city with a 1st class school district may force combination immediately upon annexation</a>.
  The annexing school district <em>may</em>
  <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-24-ps-education/pa-st-sect-24-2-230.html"
     title="Pennsylvania Statutes Title 24 P.S. Education § 2-230. Approval of contracts and changes after vote for annexation"
     >takes over contracting duties immediately</a>.
  According to
  <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/uconsCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&yr=1949&sessInd=0&smthLwInd=0&act=14&chpt=2&sctn=2&subsctn=0"
     title="PA Public School Code Act 14 of 1949 § 2-202"
     >PA Act 14</a>, Pittsburgh SD is considered 1st class "A" by its population and Wilkinsburg is considered 3rd class.
</p>
<p>
  However, the <b>school districts</b> could merge independent of the municipalities, according to
  <a
      href="https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-24-ps-education/pa-st-sect-24-2-224.html"
      title="Pennsylvania Statutes Title 24 P.S. Education § 2-224. Combination of school districts"
      >current PA law</a>.
  <b>Both school boards</b> would each have to approve and <b>the State Board of Education</b> would then have to approve.
</p>

<h2>Other fees</h2>

<p>There are a variety of other fee differences between the municipalities.</p>

<h3>Dog Licensing</h3>

<p>
  Pennsylvania law requires all licensing for all dogs and requires re-licensing those dogs when moving
  between jurisdictions with different systems. This generally means between counties.
  While Wilkinsburg participates in Allegheny County's combined dog licensing system, Pittsburgh does not.
  It is unclear if re-registration would be required and if any fees would be assessed as a result of that.
  The rates and structures are different.

  <b>Analysis.</b>
  Pittsburgh dog licensing is unfriendly to canine breeders and people whose breeds may live longer than 12 years.
  Someone residing in Pittsburgh can expect to pay up to $100 for a long-lived, desexed (spayed/neutered) dog license while AC would pay only $31.50 for it.

<h2 id="changelog">Changelog</h2>

<ul>
  <li><p>
      <time datetime="2022-04-23">April 23</time>: The mean assessment and median household income have been adjusted to align with the most recent data for each: March 2022 and 2020 ACS, respectively. This new data actually demonstrates an <em>increase</em> in the gravity of the tax increase on a Wilkinsburg homeowner at the medians: a 36% increase in the increase, from approximately $30 to approximately $41. Also, the calculator now uses the placeholder values that are the medians for each if no data is entered. Also, the help text directs the user to their latest Wilkinsburg tax return for greatest accuracy, as federal IRS 1040 Adjusted Gross Income is different from what Wilkinsburg includes in earned income. Beware of tax calculators that make this mistake!</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>
    <time datetime="2022-04-18">April 18</time>: The calculator got a light visual update. Notably, it shows
    the delta right by the calculate button instead of relying on the user to find it in the table below.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <time datetime="2022-03-27">March 27</time>: The calculator clarifies earned income,
    directs users to their W-2 for it, and adds the 107.2% magic number explanation and dog licensing section.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <time datetime="2021-12-27">December 27</time>: By popular request, the calculator now features a line for Allegheny County Real Estate Tax of 4.73 mills and the total
    now includes that tax, as well.
    Also, the rounding of the figures was tuned to cents instead of dollars as some users see a difference between the WCDC calculator and this
    and think that one or the other is wrong when they're both right!
    Also, the WilkinsburgMerger.org calculator has not yet been updated to reflect the PPS tax increase, so calculations will not match until they do so.

    <time datetime="2021-12-23">December 23</time>: Pittsburgh Public Schools raised the school property tax to 10.25 mills from 9.95 mills, as reported by
    <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2021/12/22/Pittsburgh-Public-Schools-board-tax-increase-vote-PPS-district-2022-budget/stories/202112210105">Post-Gazette</a>
    and as <a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/pa/pghboe/Board.nsf/files/C9KMVU5CE971/$file/Real%20Property%20Tax%20Levies%20(2022)%20(10.25%20mills).pdf">written in the resolution</a>.
    The calculator has been adjusted accordingly.

    <time datetime="2021-12-13">December 13</time>: Wilkinsburg CDC launched
    <a href="https://wilkinsburgmerger.org/calculator/">its own calculator</a>,
    the <a
           href="https://wilkinsburgmerger.org/wp-content/themes/burg2burgh/js/taxCalculator.js">math of which</a>
    I've verified as accurate as of 2021-12-13 15:41 with
    <abbr title="949c65525095634b4ae3cd23d7ff820c532d86b43e343cdb309a023028a92b7f">sha256:949c6552</abbr>.
    Our displayed numbers disagree by a dollar or so, as I've chosen to round to the nearest
    dollar for display purposes since I find that easier to do headmath when the cents don't matter much.
    The WCDC calculator does show how much more or less the user will pay, but it does not easily afford a good/bad signal
    as this calculator does.

    <time datetime="2021-12-11">December 11</time>: I'm aware that the Pittsburgh SD may raise its taxes, according to
    <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2021/12/09/Pittsburgh-Public-Schools-board-consider-property-tax-increase/stories/202112080166"
       >Pittsburgh Public Schools board may consider property tax increase</a>, published in the Post-Gazette.
    I will adjust the calculator upon any rate change that I hear about.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <time datetime="2021-11-19">November 19</time>: I removed the "Pittsburgh, Wilkinsburg SD (no school district merger)" scenario from the calculator and graphs
    Per
    <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-24-ps-education/pa-st-sect-24-2-229.html">PA Title 24 § 2-229</a>, which indicates that the school districts would merge
    immediately upon annexation, this scenario is legally impossible so it's not worth considering anymore.
    This estimated taxation if Pittsburgh annexed Wilkinsburg,
    but the school districts <em>didn't not merge</em> or delay merging with no adjustment to school tax rates.
  </li></p>
  <li><p>
    <time datetime="2021-11-18">November 18</time>: The calculator now includes the City of Pittsburgh
    <a href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/finance/tax-faqs#36">library tax</a> of 0.25 mills in
    real estate tax calculations. Wilkinsburg does not have a similar tax.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
    <time datetime="2021-11-07">November 7</time>: The calculator now includes the City of Pittsburgh
    <a href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/finance/tax-descriptions#476">parks tax</a> of 0.5 mills in
    real estate tax calculations. Wilkinsburg does not have a similar tax.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
    <time datetime="2021-07-13">July 13</time>: The calculator had a bug that double-counted
    EIT in the "school merger only" scenario and failed to account for higher city EIT in the
    "no school merger" scenario. The effect on the former is miniscule but the effect on the latter
    is significant. Sorry for the error and thanks to Chris Peplin for providing
    <a href="https://github.com/colindean/wilkinsburg_pittsburgh_merger_analysis/pull/6">a fix</a> for
    <a href="https://github.com/colindean/wilkinsburg_pittsburgh_merger_analysis/issues/5">the problem</a>
    I identified but didn't have time to fix on July 8.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
    <time datetime="2021-07-08">July 8</time>: The calculator was updated to reflect the
    2021-2022 Wilkinsburg SD school real estate tax reduction to 26.5 mills,
    approved at the <time datetime="2021-06-22">June 22</time> board meeting.
    Calculations performed before July 8 do not include this and the present Wilkinsburg
    scenario is now lower.
